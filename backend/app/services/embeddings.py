"""Sentence Transformers embeddings — Phase 8 RAG foundation.

Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim) for both indexing (chunks) and querying.
This model is small (~80 MB), runs on CPU, and gives good semantic similarity
for English course material.

The model is lazy-loaded once and cached for the lifetime of the process.
That means the first call after a server restart pays the load cost (~5-15s);
all subsequent calls are fast (~10-50ms per chunk).

DAA Unit IV / cosine distance — embeddings live in a 384-dim vector space and
similarity is computed via the cosine distance operator (`<=>`) in pgvector.
